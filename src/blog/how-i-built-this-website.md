The idea behind this website is to make a personnal website to show my projects and have a blog.

## The stack.

To build this website I use [Gatsby v2](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Gatsby his a static site generator which is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Graphql](https://graphql.org) (both technologies that i like). For more information visit https://gatsbyjs.org/. To style the whole website I use my poor css skill but wih the help of [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Css Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
